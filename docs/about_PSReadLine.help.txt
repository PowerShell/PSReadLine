SHORT DESCRIPTION

    PSReadLine provides an improved command line editing experience in
    the PowerShell console.

LONG DESCRIPTION

    PSReadLine provides a powerful command line editing experience for the
    PowerShell console.  It provides:

      * Syntax coloring of the command line
      * A visual indication of syntax errors
      * A better multi-line experience (both editing and history)
      * Customizable key bindings
      * Cmd and Emacs modes
      * Many configuration options
      * Bash style completion (optional in Cmd mode, default in Emacs mode)
      * Emacs yank/kill ring
      * PowerShell token based "word" movement and kill

    The following functions are available in the class [Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine]:

{{FUNCTION_DESCRIPTIONS}}

  Custom Key Bindings
  -------------------

  PSReadLine supports custom key bindings using the cmdlet Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler.  Most
  custom key bindings will call one of the above functions, for example:

      Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Key UpArrow -Function HistorySearchBackward

  You can bind a ScriptBlock to a key.  The ScriptBlock can do pretty much anything you want.
  Some useful examples include:

      * edit the command line
      * opening a new window (e.g. help)
      * change directories without changing the command line

  The ScriptBlock is passed two arguments:

      * $key - A [ConsoleKeyInfo] that is the key that triggered the custom binding.  If you bind
               the same ScriptBlock to multiple keys and need to perform different actions depending
               on the key, you can check $key.  Many custom bindings ignore this argument.
      * $arg - An arbitrary argument.  Most often, this would be an integer argument that the user
               passes from the key bindings DigitArgument.  If your binding doesn't accept arguments,
               it's reasonable to ignore this argument.

  Let's take a look at an example that adds a command line to history without executing it.  This is
  useful when you realize you forgot to do something, but don't want to re-enter the command line
  you've already entered.

        Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Key Alt+w `
                                 -BriefDescription SaveInHistory `
                                 -LongDescription "Save current line in history but do not execute" `
                                 -ScriptBlock {
            param($key, $arg)   # The arguments are ignored in this example

            # We need the command line, GetBufferState gives us that (with the cursor position)
            $line = $null
            $cursor = $null
            [Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine]::GetBufferState([ref]$line, [ref]$cursor)

            # AddToHistory saves the line in history, but does not execute the line.
            [Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine]::AddToHistory($line)

            # RevertLine is like pressing Escape.
            [Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine]::RevertLine()
        }

  You can see many more examples in the file SamplePSReadLineProfile.ps1 which is installed in the
  PSReadLine module folder.

  Most key bindings will want to take advantage of some helper functions for editing the command
  line those APIs are documented in the next section.

  Custom Key Binding Support APIs
  -------------------------------

  The following functions are public in Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine, but cannot be directly
  bound to a key.  Most are useful in custom key bindings.

    void AddToHistory(string command)

        Add a command line to history without executing it.

    void ClearKillRing()

        Clear the kill ring.  This is mostly used for testing.

    void Delete(int start, int length)

        Delete length characters from start.  This operation supports undo/redo.

    void Ding()

        Perform the Ding action based on the users preference.

    void GetBufferState([ref] string input, [ref] int cursor)
    void GetBufferState([ref] Ast ast, [ref] Token[] tokens, [ref] ParseError[] parseErrors, [ref] int cursor)

        These two functions retrieve useful information about the current state of
        the input buffer.  The first is more commonly used for simple cases.  The
        second is used if your binding is doing something more advanced with the Ast.

    IEnumerable[Microsoft.PowerShell.KeyHandler] GetKeyHandlers(bool includeBound, bool includeUnbound)

        This function is used by Get-PSReadLineKeyHandler and probably isn't useful in a custom
        key binding.

    Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLineOptions GetOptions()

        This function is used by Get-PSReadLineOption and probably isn't too useful in a custom
        key binding.

    void GetSelectionState([ref] int start, [ref] int length)

        If there is no selection on the command line, -1 will be returned in both start and length.
        If there is a selection on the command line, the start and length of the selection are returned.

    void Insert(char c)
    void Insert(string s)

        Insert a character or string at the cursor.  This operation supports undo/redo.

    string ReadLine(runspace remoteRunspace, System.Management.Automation.EngineIntrinsics engineIntrinsics)

        This is the main entry point to PSReadLine. It does not support recursion, so is not useful
        in a custom key binding.

    void RemoveKeyHandler(string[] key)

        This function is used by Remove-PSReadLineKeyHandler and probably isn't too useful in a
        custom key binding.

    void Replace(int start, int length, string replacement)

        Replace some of the input.  This operation supports undo/redo.
        This is preferred over Delete followed by Insert because it is treated as a single action
        for undo.

    void SetCursorPosition(int cursor)

        Move the cursor to the given offset.  Cursor movement is not tracked for undo.

    void SetOptions(Microsoft.PowerShell.SetPSReadLineOption options)

        This function is a helper method used by the cmdlet Set-PSReadLineOption, but might be
        useful to a custom key binding that wants to temporarily change a setting.

    bool TryGetArgAsInt(System.Object arg, [ref] int numericArg, int defaultNumericArg)

        This helper method is used for custom bindings that honor DigitArgument.  A typical call
        looks like:

            [int]$numericArg = 0
            [Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine]::TryGetArgAsInt($arg, [ref]$numericArg, 1)

POWERSHELL COMPATIBILITY

    PSReadLine requires PowerShell version 3 or greater and the console host.  It
    will not work in the ISE.
