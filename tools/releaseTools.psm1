#.SYNOPSIS
#In the release workflow, the release branch will be merged back to master after the release is done,
#and a merge commit will be created as the child of the release tag commit.
#This cmdlet takes a release tag or the corresponding commit hash, find its child merge commit, and
#return its metadata in this format: <merge-commit-hash>|<parent-commit-hashes>
#
#.PARAMETER LastReleaseTag
#The last release tag
#
#.PARAMETER CommitHash
#The commit hash of the last release tag
#
#.OUTPUTS
#Return the metadata of the child merge commit, in this format: <merge-commit-hash>|<parent-commit-hashes>
