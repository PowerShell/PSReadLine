SHORT DESCRIPTION

    PSReadline provides an improved command line editing experience in
    the PowerShell console.

LONG DESCRIPTION

    PSReadline provides a powerful command line editing experience for the
    PowerShell console.  It provides:

      * Syntax coloring of the command line
      * A visual indication of syntax errors
      * A better multi-line experience (both editing and history)
      * Customizable key bindings
      * Cmd and Emacs modes
      * Many configuration options
      * Bash style completion (optional in Cmd mode, default in Emacs mode)
      * Emacs yank/kill ring
      * PowerShell token based "word" movement and kill
    
    The following functions are available in the class [PSConsoleUtilities.PSConsoleReadLine]:

  Cursor movement
  ---------------

    EndOfLine                (Cmd: <End>                Emacs: <End> or <Ctrl-E>)

        Move the cursor to the end of the input.

    BeginningOfLine          (Cmd: <Home>               Emacs: <Home> or <Ctrl-A>)

        Move the cursor to the start of the input.

    ForwardChar              (Cmd: <RightArrow>         Emacs: <RightArrow> or <Ctrl-F>)

        Move the cursor one character to the right.  This may move the cursor to the next
        line of multi-line input.

    BackwardChar             (Cmd: <LeftArrow>          Emacs: <LeftArrow> or <Ctrl-B>)

        Move the cursor one character to the left.  This may move the cursor to the previous
        line of multi-line input.

    EmacsForwardWord         (Cmd: unbound              Emacs: <Alt-F>)

        Move the cursor forward to the end of the current word, or if between words,
        to the end of the next word.

    ForwardWord              (Cmd: <Ctrl-RightArrow>    Emacs: unbound)

        Move the cursor forward to the start of the next word.

    BackwardWord             (Cmd: <Ctrl-LeftArrow>     Emacs: unbound)

        Move the cursor back to the start of the current word, or if between words,
        the start of the previous word.

    EmacsBackwardWord        (Cmd: unbound              Emacs: <Alt-B>)

        Move the cursor back to the start of the current word, or if between words,
        the start of the previous word.

    AddLine                  (Cmd: <Shift-Enter>        Emacs: <Shift-Enter>)

        The continuation prompt is displayed on the next line and PSReadline waits for
        keys to edit the current input.  This is useful to enter multi-line input as
        a single command even when a single line is complete input by itself.

  Basic editing
  -------------

    RevertLine               (Cmd: <ESC>                Emacs: <Alt-R>)

        Reverts all of the input since the last input was accepted and executed.

    BackwardDeleteChar       (Cmd: <Backspace>          Emacs: <Backspace> or <Ctrl-H>)

        Delete the character before the cursor.

    DeleteChar               (Cmd: <Delete>             Emacs: <Delete>)

        Delete the character under the cursor.

    AcceptLine               (Cmd: <Enter>              Emacs: <Enter> or <Ctrl-M>)

        Attempt to execute the current input.  If the current input is incomplete (for
        example there is a missing closing parenthesis, bracket, or quote, then the
        continuation prompt is displayed on the next line and PSReadline waits for
        keys to edit the current input.

  History
  -------

    ClearHistory             (Cmd: unbound              Emacs: unbound)

        Clears history in PSReadline.  This does not affect PowerShell history.

    PreviousHistory          (Cmd: <UpArrow>            Emacs: <UpArrow>)

        Replace the current input with the 'previous' item from PSReadline history.

    NextHistory              (Cmd: <DownArrow>          Emacs: <DownArrow>)

        Replace the current input with the 'next' item from PSReadline history.

    HistorySearchBackward    (Cmd: unbound              Emacs: unbound)

        Replace the current input with the 'previous' item from PSReadline history
        that matches the characters between the start and the input and the cursor.

    HistorySearchForward     (Cmd: unbound              Emacs: unbound)

        Replace the current input with the 'next' item from PSReadline history
        that matches the characters between the start and the input and the cursor.

  Tab Completion
  --------------

    TabCompleteNext          (Cmd: <Tab>                Emacs: unbound)

        Attempt to complete the text surrounding the cursor with the next
        available completion.

    TabCompletePrevious      (Cmd: <Shift-Tab>          Emacs: unbound)

        Attempt to complete the text surrounding the cursor with the next
        previous completion.

    Complete                 (Cmd: unbound              Emacs: <Tab>)

        Attempt to perform completion on the text surrounding the cursor.
        If there are multiple possible completions, the longest unambiguous
        prefix is used for completion.  If trying to complete the longest
        unambiguous completion, a list of possible completions is displayed.

    PossibleCompletions      (Cmd: <Ctrl-Space>         Emacs: <Alt-Equals>)
    
        Display the list of possible completions.

    SetMark                  (Cmd: unbound              Emacs: <Alt-Space>)

        Mark the current loction of the cursor for use in a subsequent editing command.

    ExchangePointAndMark     (Cmd: unbound              Emacs: <Ctrl-X,Ctrl-X>)

        The cursor is placed at the location of the mark and the mark is moved
        to the location of the cursor.

  Kill/Yank
  ---------

  Kill and yank operate on a clipboard in the PSReadline module.  There is a ring
  buffer called the kill ring - killed text will be added to the kill ring up
  and yank will copy text from the most recent kill.  YankPop will cycle through
  items in the kill ring.  When the kill ring is full, new items will replace the
  oldest items.  A kill operation that is immediately preceded by another kill operation
  will append the previous kill instead of adding a new item or replacing an item
  in the kill ring.  This is how you can cut a part of a line, say for example with multiple
  KillWord operations, then yank them back elsewhere as a single yank.

    KillLine                 (Cmd: unbound              Emacs: <Ctrl-K>)

        Clear the input from the cursor to the end of the line.  The cleared text is placed
        in the kill ring.

    BackwardKillLine         (Cmd: unbound              Emacs: <Ctrl-U> or <Ctrl-X,Backspace>)

        Clear the input from the start of the input to the cursor.  The cleared text is placed
        in the kill ring.

    KillWord                 (Cmd: unbound              Emacs: <Alt-D>)

        Clear the input from the cursor to the end of the current word.  If the cursor
        is between words, the input is cleared from the cursor to the end of the next word.
        The cleared text is placed in the kill ring.

    KillBackwardWord         (Cmd: unbound              Emacs: <Alt-Backspace>)

        Clear the input from the start of the current word to the cursor.  If the cursor
        is between words, the input is cleared from the start of the previous word to the
        cursor.  The cleared text is placed in the kill ring.

    Yank                     (Cmd: unbound              Emacs: <Ctrl-Y>)

        Add the most recently killed text to the input.

    YankPop                  (Cmd: unbound              Emacs: <Alt-Y>)
    
        If the previous operation was Yank or YankPop, replace the previously yanked
        text with the next killed text from the kill ring.

    ClearKillRing            (Cmd: unbound              Emacs: unbound)

        The contents of the kill ring are cleared.

  Custom Key Bindings
  -------------------

  PSReadline supports custom key bindings using the cmdlet Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler.  A
  typical custom key binding will call one of the above functions, for example:

      Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key UpArrow -BriefDescription HistorySearchBackward -Handler { 
          [PSConsoleUtilities.PSConsoleReadLine]::HistorySearchBackward()
      }

  The following functions are useful when writing more advanced handlers for custom key bindings.
  They allow you to get and change the state of the input buffer.

    GetBufferState

        There are two versions of this function.  One will return the text and cursor position.
        This is useful if you want to make changes to the text.

        The other returns the Ast, tokens, and any errors.  This information is available
        by parsing the input returned from the other overload, but this overload is faster
        because the parsed version of the input is always produced to handle syntax coloring.

    SetBufferState

        This function can be used to set the text in the input buffer and/or move the cursor.

    SetCursorPosition

        This function can be used to move the cursor.


POWERSHELL COMPATIBILITY
    
    PSReadline requires PowerShell version 3 or greater and the console host.  It
    will not work in the ISE.
